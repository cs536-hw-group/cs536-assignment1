For each ip address listed here: https://iperf3serverlist.net/, run a ping test and find the min, max, and average round-trip time (rtt). Find the geolocation of the ip address from publicly available data. Do a scatter plot: distance vs rtt. Explain whether and how distance relates to rtt. What do min and max rtt convey about the distance, and the network state?
